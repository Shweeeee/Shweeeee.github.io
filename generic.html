								<h3>Main driving factor</h3>
								<p>Major regrets in my life is giving up on thing or not having faith in what i do. This something i want to change from now one in my life. My main driving force at this stage of life is to have no such regrets, it is to give my best at whatever task i have and to not stop until completion. I wish to build something which I truly believe in and dedicate my entire life into working for the this said thing.  </p>

								<p>I look upto a lot of people in my life who surround me. People are great at all sorts of things and sometimes i do feel a bit inadequate just by looking at them. I have to realisation that such a mentality is nothing but harmful to me and wont do me any good. Instead I have started to look these talented people as an inspiration of what a normal human being can achieve through sheer dedication and hardwork.</p>
