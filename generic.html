								<h3>Main driving factor</h3>
								<p>Major regret in my life is giving up on things or not having faith in what I do. This is something I want to change from now on in my life. My main driving force at this stage of life is to have no such regrets; it is to give my best at whatever task I have and to not stop until its completed. I wish to build something which I truly believe in and dedicate my entire life to work for the said thing.  </p>

								<p>I look upto a lot of people in my life who surround me. People are great at all sorts of things and sometimes I do feel a bit inadequate just by looking at them. I have come to realisation that such a mentality is nothing but harmful to me and wont do me any good. Instead I have started to look at these talented people as an inspiration of what a normal human being can achieve through sheer dedication and hardwork.</p>

								<h4>My Favourite qoute</h4>
								<p>"If life were predictable it would cease to be life, and be without flavor."<br> -Eleanor Roosevelt</p>

								<p>This qoute really makes me look forward for new things in life and work hard to achieve what I want to achieve.</p>
